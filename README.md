## Modular_Arithmetics

This is a project done at the **New Bulgarian University** in Sofia, Bulgaria. Mathematical problems in the field of modular arithmetics
are solved using mathematical algorithms.

For convention we use **Z_n** for a *residue class ring* with **n** elements, and **F_n** for a *finite field* with **n** elements,
where **n** is a natural number.

**Ex.1**: Creating a Z_n

**Ex.2**: Addition in the Z_n

**Ex.3**: Subtraction in the Z_n

**Ex.4**: Multiplication in the Z_n

**Ex.5-7**: Finding the reciprical element of a given element from the Z_n

**Ex.8**: Division in the Z_n

**Ex.9-10**: Exponentiation in Z_n using two different methods

**Ex.11**: Checking if a residue class ring is a finite field

**Ex.12**: Checking if an element from the F_n is a primitive root

**Ex.13**: Finding all primitve roots in a given F_n

**Ex.14**: Calculating discrete logarithm with a given base and an element in F_n, returns -1 if not possible.
